Given the relatively scarce body of knowledge concerning secure protocols at the time, as well <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html">the intense pressure everyone at Netscape was working under</a>, their efforts can only be seen as incredibly heroic. It’s amazing that SSL has endured for as long as it has, in contrast to a number of other protocols from the same vintage. We’ve definitely learned a lot since then, though, but the thing about protocols and APIs is that there’s very little going back.<p> <a href="/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/"><em>Read more...</em></a></article></section><aside id="info" class="content-area"><h1 title="Moxie Marlinspike">Moxie Marlinspike</h1><img class="portrait" src="/assets/portrait-mini-06764a5109a193036ba9a4305ddeb5ad3a4ccc2d289ec734e8239d293aca43ff.jpg" alt="Photo of Moxie"><aside id="contact"><ul><li class="insta"><a href="https://instagram.com/moxiemarlinspike"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i> moxiemarlinspike</a></ul></aside></aside><footer> <span class="copyright">&copy; 2012 Moxie Marlinspike</span><ul><li class="about"><a href="/index.html">About</a><li class="software"><a href="/software.html">Software</a><li class="stories"><a href="/stories.html">Stories</a><li class="other"><a href="/projects.html">Projects</a><li class="blog"><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></ul></footer></div></div><script> (function(d, t) { var g = d.createElement(t), s = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0]; g.src = '//hnbutton.appspot.com/static/hn.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s); }(document, 'script')); </script> <script type="text/javascript"> var clicky_site_ids = clicky_site_ids || []; clicky_site_ids.push(100527609); (function() { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.async = true; s.src = '//static.getclicky.com/js'; ( document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0] ).appendChild( s ); })(); </script> <noscript><p><img alt="Clicky" width="1" height="1" src="//in.getclicky.com/100527609ns.gif" /></noscript>
